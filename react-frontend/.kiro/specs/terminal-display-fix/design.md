# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the terminal display and functionality issues by implementing proper xterm.js integration, fixing sizing problems, improving input handling, and ensuring consistent styling. The solution focuses on creating a robust terminal component that handles all connection states properly and provides a smooth user experience.

## Architecture

The terminal system consists of three main components:

1. **TerminalContext** - Manages terminal state and command processing
2. **TerminalPanel** - React component that renders the xterm.js terminal
3. **CSS Styling** - Handles visual presentation and responsive behavior

The architecture maintains separation of concerns with the context handling business logic and the panel component managing the xterm.js instance lifecycle.

## Components and Interfaces

### TerminalPanel Component Fixes

**Sizing and Layout Issues:**
- Fix the terminal initialization to properly wait for container dimensions
- Implement proper ResizeObserver usage with debouncing
- Ensure FitAddon is called at the right times during the component lifecycle
- Add proper cleanup for event listeners and observers

**Input Handling Improvements:**
- Fix the onData handler to properly process different types of input
- Implement proper command line editing with backspace support
- Add proper cursor management and line buffering
- Handle special keys (arrows, home, end) appropriately

**State Management:**
- Improve the connection state handling in the terminal display
- Fix the terminal writer function to avoid duplicate prompts
- Ensure proper cleanup when switching between states
- Add proper error handling for terminal operations

### TerminalContext Enhancements

**Command Processing:**
- Improve the command execution flow to be more reliable
- Add proper command history management
- Implement better error handling for command failures
- Fix the clear terminal functionality

**Writer Function:**
- Redesign the terminal writer to handle output more reliably
- Prevent duplicate prompts and formatting issues
- Add proper line ending handling
- Implement better integration with xterm.js output

### CSS Styling Improvements

**Layout Fixes:**
- Fix flexbox layout issues that cause sizing problems
- Ensure proper height calculations for the terminal container
- Improve responsive behavior for different screen sizes
- Fix overflow and scrolling issues

**Theme Consistency:**
- Standardize color variables usage across light and dark themes
- Improve contrast and readability
- Fix scrollbar styling for better visual integration
- Ensure proper focus and selection styling

## Data Models

### Terminal State Model
```typescript
interface TerminalState {
  status: 'disconnected' | 'connecting' | 'connected' | 'error';
  currentCommand: string;
  commandHistory: string[];
  isInitialized: boolean;
}
```

### Terminal Configuration
```typescript
interface TerminalConfig {
  theme: TerminalTheme;
  fontSize: number;
  fontFamily: string;
  rows: number;
  cols: number;
  scrollback: number;
}
```

## Error Handling

**Terminal Initialization Errors:**
- Handle cases where xterm.js fails to initialize
- Provide fallback behavior when FitAddon fails
- Add proper error boundaries for terminal component failures

**Command Execution Errors:**
- Catch and display command processing errors appropriately
- Handle cases where terminal writer is not available
- Provide user feedback for connection failures

**Resize and Layout Errors:**
- Handle ResizeObserver failures gracefully
- Provide fallback sizing when automatic fitting fails
- Prevent infinite resize loops

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Test terminal context state management
- Test command processing logic
- Test terminal writer functionality
- Test error handling scenarios

**Integration Tests:**
- Test terminal component lifecycle
- Test resize behavior and responsiveness
- Test theme switching functionality
- Test connection state transitions

**Visual Tests:**
- Verify terminal displays correctly in different container sizes
- Test scrollbar appearance and functionality
- Verify theme consistency across different states
- Test focus and selection visual feedback
