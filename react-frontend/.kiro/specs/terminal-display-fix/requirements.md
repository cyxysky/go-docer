# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current terminal implementation has several display and functionality issues that need to be fixed. The terminal uses xterm.js but has problems with sizing, input handling, command processing, and visual consistency. This feature will address these issues to provide a properly functioning terminal interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the terminal to display properly with correct sizing and layout, so that I can use it effectively within the application interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the terminal panel is rendered THEN the terminal SHALL fill the available space correctly
2. WHEN the container is resized THEN the terminal SHALL automatically adjust its dimensions
3. WHEN the terminal is initialized THEN it SHALL display without layout issues or overflow problems
4. WHEN switching between light and dark themes THEN the terminal SHALL maintain proper visual consistency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the terminal input handling to work correctly, so that I can type commands and see proper feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type characters in the terminal THEN they SHALL appear correctly at the cursor position
2. WHEN I press Enter THEN the command SHALL be processed and executed properly
3. WHEN I use backspace THEN characters SHALL be deleted correctly from the current line
4. WHEN the terminal is not connected THEN input SHALL be handled appropriately without errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the terminal command processing to work reliably, so that I can execute commands and see expected output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute a valid command THEN the output SHALL be displayed correctly
2. WHEN I execute an invalid command THEN an appropriate error message SHALL be shown
3. WHEN command output is displayed THEN a new prompt SHALL appear on the next line
4. WHEN I clear the terminal THEN the content SHALL be cleared and a fresh prompt SHALL appear

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the terminal connection states to be handled properly, so that I understand when the terminal is ready for use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the terminal is disconnected THEN appropriate messaging SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN connecting to the terminal THEN a loading state SHALL be shown
3. WHEN the terminal is connected THEN it SHALL be ready to accept commands
4. WHEN connection fails THEN an error state SHALL be displayed with clear messaging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the terminal styling to be consistent and professional, so that it integrates well with the overall application design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the terminal is displayed THEN it SHALL use consistent colors and fonts
2. WHEN using the terminal THEN scrollbars SHALL be styled appropriately
3. WHEN text is selected in the terminal THEN it SHALL have proper selection styling
4. WHEN the terminal has focus THEN it SHALL have appropriate focus indicators
